The keylogger is made for ethical purposes only!!!

PS: There is also advanced version of keylogger developed by me, mail me to know more about it :)

This keylogger has a GUI to start and stop its functioning.

1."test.py" contains the keylogger code

2."logs.json" contains the keystrokes used by the target

3. Rest file are for the encryption purpose, which I didn't used in advanced this particular keylogger project
